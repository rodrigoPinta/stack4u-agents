# Stack4U

Financial AI agents designed for professionals. Explainable. Conservative. Human-in-the-loop.

## Overview

Stack4U is a platform of financial AI agents for accounting, auditing, reconciliation, and financial analysis. Our agents are built to assist human professionals—not replace human judgment or decision-making.

All agents operate under a governance-first approach, prioritizing transparency, accountability, and control. They are advisory by design, providing recommendations and analysis while final decisions always remain with humans.
