            <h2>Responsible AI & Governance</h2>
            <p>Stack4U builds financial AI agents designed to support professionals, not replace human judgment.</p>
            <p>Our agents are advisory by design: they analyze, flag risks, and explain findings, while final decisions always remain with humans.</p>
            <p>We follow a governance-first approach inspired by established enterprise risk-management principles, prioritizing transparency, accountability, and control.</p>
            <p>All agents operate with clear scope boundaries, conservative behavior when uncertain, and full explainability of their outputs.</p>
            <p>Source financial data is never altered, and critical actions always require human approval.</p>
            <p>This approach ensures Stack4U's AI remains trustworthy, auditable, and aligned with the serious nature of financial work.</p>
